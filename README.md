# first_flex_landing_page
A go at applying flexbox principles to create an entire landing page

- created all items from scratch based on given web page plan
- simulated designer / client making build requests
- used flex for 95% of all item formatting, as practiced was conciously intended
- compromised flex-wrap features to fix issues with overflow. Adding a min-width also seemed to help, but is a temporary fix.
- could not get some colours to exact specs despite experimentation. Ideally will use graphic design tools to pinpoint exaxt pixel colour from design image.
- learnt how to round buttons, which i did not know prior
- this particular layout has a decent flow. I will keep it for future use.
